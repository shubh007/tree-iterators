# Tree Iterators

We will implemnet diffrent types of iterator(preorder,postorder,etc..) on tree.

It will cover **facotry design pattren** in getting type of iterator and
**iterator design pattern** to iterate over the tree.


Here is the [Test Class](https://github.com/shubh007/tree-iterators/tree/master/src/test/java/io/tailf/design/treeiterator/binarytree).


**Tree Used In test (level order traversal):** [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

**Excepted traversals :** 

**Pre order :** [1,2,4,5,3,6,7]

**Post order :** [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]

**In order :** [4,2,5,1,6,3,7]
